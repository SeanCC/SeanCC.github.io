				<p><strong>Relative Harm and Pretrial Detention</strong></p>
<p>According to the Prison Policy Institute in 2020, more than 470,000 people at any one time are sitting in local jails without a conviction. These people, along with many in federal detention, are in what is known as <em>pretrial detention</em>: they are sitting in jail, their lives on hold, awaiting the outcome of a court case. Many of these people will eventually accept plea deals - not necessarily because they are guilty, but because a guilty plea is the quickest way out.</p>
<p>It is often difficult to conceptualize the harm done to people detained by the state. In some ways, conceptualizing the harm wrought by a crime is easier - we can imagine the frustration of having our treasured belongings stolen, or the fear and pain of a violent assault. The harm caused by many crimes is familiar, and we can draw analogies to our own experiences. Most of us have never been separated entirely from society, from our lives, trapped in a box and stored away for weeks, months, or years at a time. There is no analogy for us to draw in when imagining the harm of even a short stay in jail.</p>
<p>Recently, I came across a very interesting paper: <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3787018">Pretrial Detention and the Value of Liberty</a>. The authors, Megan Stevenson and Sandra Mayson of the University of Virginia School of Law and the Univerity of Pennsylvania Carey Law School respectively, published <a href="https://theappeal.org/virtually-no-one-is-dangerous-enough-to-justify-jail/">an article in The Appeal</a> describing the surveys they conducted in the paper. In their research, they try to quantify the harm caused by detention using a clever strategy: by tying that harm directly to the crimes that put people in jail.</p>
<p>Just how much more, or less, harm does our justice system do than the people it detains? With the results from Stevenson and Mayson, we can visualize that.</p>
<p>In the United States, 36,000 people are detained pretrial on a robbery offense. There is a wide range to how long pretrial detention can last, from as little as one or two days to months at a time, and even years in egregious cases.</p>
<p>We can imagine two axes, like the arms of a scale: one the harm allegedly done by the defendant in committing a crime (as represented by the &lsquo;relative harm&rsquo; axis), and the other the harm done by the state to the defendant in detaining them (as represented by the &lsquo;detention&rsquo; axis). What does that balance look like?</p>
<script type = 'text/javascript' src='https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.4.2.min.js'></script>
<div id='harmDiv'></div>
<script>
	
	var NumberOfPeople = 37000;
	var detPeriod = Array(180).fill().map((element, index) => index + 1);
	var relHarms = Array(100).fill().map((element, index) => (index + 1)/2);
	var detHarms = [];
	var crimeHarms = [];
	for(var i =0; i< detPeriod.length; i++){
		var dRow = [];
		var cRow = [];
		for(var j = 0; j< relHarms.length; j++){
			dRow.push(detPeriod[i]*NumberOfPeople);
			cRow.push(relHarms[j]*NumberOfPeople);
			}
		detHarms.push(dRow);
		crimeHarms.push(cRow);
	};
	
	var layout = {
	  title: 'Harm of Detention vs Relative Harm of Offense'
	};

	detData = {
		x:detPeriod,
		y:relHarms,
		z:detHarms,
		type:'surface'
	};
	crimeData = {
		x:detPeriod,
		y:relHarms,
		z:crimeHarms,
		type:'surface'
	};
	var data = [detData, crimeData];
	
	Plotly.newPlot('harmDiv', data);
</script>

<p>Here, the Z-axis is &lsquo;harm&rsquo;, as measured by days in jail. The X-axis is &lsquo;relative harm&rsquo;, also measured by days in jail. This is the conversion rate of harm from the crime in question to a comparable harm caused by a number of days in jail. The Y-axis is detention period for a person detained on the given crime.</p>
<p>In Stevenson and Mayson&rsquo;s paper, they analyze pretrial detention under a consequentialist framework. Under this framework, the benefit of detaining people pretrial is in the harm&rsquo;s prevented by that detention. Assuming that detaining a person pretrial only makes sense when the benefit of doing so outweighs the cost, we need only analyze the costs - the harm caused to detainees by detention - and the benefits - the hypothetical crimes prevented during detention.</p>
